# C

## Basics

Before C99 only block comments in the form `/* ... */` were allowed; starting with the C99 standard, however, C also allows C++-style single-line comments in the form `//`.

Before C99 in all blocks, thus including the body of function definitions, declarations were required to precede statements:
```c
{
  // declarations
  // statements
}
```

This requirement was dropped in C99 though.
